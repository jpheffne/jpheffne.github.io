Personal website built using Distill for R Markdown.

Site will be accessible at [https://joeyheffner.com](https://joeyheffner.com) in the future.

I followed a [great tutorial](https://alison.rbind.io/blog/2020-12-postcards-distill/) by Alison Hill and used [Jae-Young Son's github.io](https://github.com/psychNerdJae/psychnerdjae.github.io) as a template and inspiration.
