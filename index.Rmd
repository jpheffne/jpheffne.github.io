Joseph Heffner's current research investigates human social cognition and decision-making, focusing particularly on how people respond to fairness violations. He utilizes behavioral economics and social psychology approaches to explore questions like: In what contexts do people value punishment over non-punitive alternatives? How do people learn the value of prosocial actions in ambiguous and noisy environments? What aspects of the environment influence decisions to compete or cooperate?
